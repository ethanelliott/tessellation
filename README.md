# About

Welcome to tessellation. A tessellation is a covering of a surface using various
geometric shapes, in such a way that there are no overlaps or gaps.

This framework will allow you to build an application by combining generic
components, rather than implementing each part manually. This means that you can
build an express application with a swagger page without having to describe the
swagger implementation.

This takes a lot of inspiration from front-end frameworks, which allow building
interfaces by combining components that can scope their own functionality and
state. By providing an easy way to describe these components and connect them
together, you can focus on writing the code that drives business value rather
than re-implement basic requirements.
